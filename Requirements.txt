Stripe Integration
* Users should have a Stripe customer token in the users table
* Javascript should prevent Pro form from submitting after user completes,
and should send card info to Stripe.  Stripe will return with  card token.
* Javascript should send user fields + card token to our Rails app. Rails app
should validate the user fields.  Rails app will note whether plan 1 or 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back 
customer token. Rails should save customer token and user info to our db.
